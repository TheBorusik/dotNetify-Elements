## Introduction

<p style="font-size: 1.2rem">
_DotNetify-Elements_ provide a set of free, open-source React components that you can readily connect to your cross-platform .NET back-end in an MVVM fashion, and effortlessly get your data streaming in real-time through WebSocket.
</p>

_Elements_ incorporate and curate many other existing, widely-adopted open-source libraries to allow you to leverage the React community's tried-and-true favorites in your application with greater ease and speed.  The components are designed to plug-and-play with your C# view models and with reactive programming model that can bring so much simplicity to the way you code!

#### The Basics

Let's revisit the Hello World example (if you're not familiar with _dotNetify_, [read the overview first!](http://dotnetify.net/react)) :

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import dotnetify from 'dotnetify';

class MyApp extends React.Component {
   constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      dotnetify.react.connect("HelloWorld", this);
      this.state = { Greetings: "" };
   }
   render() {
      return <div>{this.state.Greetings}</div>
   }
}
```
```csharp
using DotNetify;

public class HelloWorld : BaseVM
{
   public string Greetings => "Hello World!";
}
```

With _Elements_, the above React component can be succintly rewritten as a stateless functional component:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { VMContext, Element } from 'dotnetify-elements';

const MyApp = _ => (
   <VMContext vm="HelloWorld">
      <div><Element id="Greetings" /></div>
   </VMContext>
);
```

The _VMContext_ component takes over the work of connecting to the back-end view model, and supplies data to the _Element_ components within its scope.  The __id__ attribute is utilized to associate the component a particular view model property for its data source. 

While the _Element_ component itself may not seem to do much, it packs some internal APIs that its sub-components can use to not only receive, but also send data back to the back-end.

#### Receiving Inputs

Here's how we use _TextField_, a sub-component of _Element_, to accept user input:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { VMContext, Element, TextField } from 'dotnetify-elements';

const MyApp = _ => (
   <VMContext vm="NameInput">
      <TextField  id="Name" label="Name:" placeholder="Enter your name" />
      <br/>You typed: <b><Element id="Name" /></b>
   </VMContext>
);
```
[inset]

```csharp
public class NameInput : BaseVM
{
   public NameInput()
   {
      AddProperty<string>("Name");
   }
}
```

While you type, the _TextField_ element updates the state that's stored locally inside _VMContext_, which is also shared by the _Element_ element.  When it loses focus (or when the Enter key is pressed), the _TextField_ will dispatch the updated state to the back-end view model.

Notice that the view model uses a reactive property instead of the usual C# property.  Reactive properties are declared at runtime inside the constructor, and as you will see in later examples, they can make your logic much more expressive and fluent.

#### Attributes and Validations

What's interesting about the _Elements_ is that not only it works with property values, but that you can actually initialize their attributes from the view model.  The reactive property type provides __WithAttribute__ method to include the attributes along with the initial state:

```jsx
const MyApp = _ => (
   <VMContext vm="NameGenderInput">
      <TextField  id="Name" />
      <DropdownList id="Gender" />
   </VMContext>
);
```
[inset]
```csharp
public class NameGenderInput : BaseVM
{
   public NameGenderInput()
   {
      AddProperty<string>("Name")
         .WithAttribute(new TextFieldAttribute { Label = "Name:", Placeholder = "Enter your name" });

      AddProperty("Gender", "")
         .WithAttribute(new DropdownListAttribute
         {
            Label = "Gender:",
            Placeholder = "Select your gender...",
            Options = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
               { "", "" },
               { "M", "Male" },
               { "F", "Female" }
            }.ToArray()
         });
   }
}
```

The namespace __DotNetify.Elements__ provides attribute types for various _Elements_.  Similarly, you can also specify validation attributes for the input Elements, i.e. required attribute, regular expression pattern, number min/max, date range, and even custom server-side validation.  The example below uses a sub-component of _TextField_, an element that only accepts whole numbers:

```jsx
const PrimeInput = _ => (
   <VMContext vm="PrimeInput">
      <NumberField id="Prime" />
   </VMContext>
);
```
[inset]

```csharp
public class PrimeInput : BaseVM
{
   public PrimeInput()
   {
      AddProperty<int?>("Prime")
         .WithAttribute(new TextFieldAttribute
         {
            Label = "Number:",
            Placeholder = "Enter a prime number between 2 and 100"
         })
         .WithRequiredValidation()
         .WithMinValidation(2)
         .WithMaxValidation(100)
         .WithServerValidation(ValidatePrimeNumber, "Not a prime number");
   }

   private bool ValidatePrimeNumber(int? number)
   {
      if (number != null && number >= 2 && number <= 100)
         for (int i = 2; i < number; i++)
            if (number % i == 0) return false;
      return true;
   }
}
```

Placing these input elements inside a _Form_ element will give you much more features, including the ability to perform form-level validation, submission and error handling, dirty checking, and more.  We will cover this topic more in the other section.

Note that the attribute types are just there to help you to figure out things that can be configured, but the usage is completely optional.  They can be substituted with anonymous object:

```csharp
AddProperty<string>("Name")
   .WithAttribute(new { Label = "Name:", Placeholder = "Enter your name" })
```

#### Real-Time Streaming

_DotNetify-Elements_ gives you real-time data streaming capability _by default_.  Every view model is capable of pushing data to the client in real-time.  Combine this MVVM paradigm with reactive programming on both the front- and back-end, and you get a powerful framework for tackling the complexity of real-time programming.

As this project continues to grow and attracts participation, we hope to add many more components for real-time visualization and interaction.  Stay in the loop by following our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dotnetify)!
